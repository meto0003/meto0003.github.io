            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is <b>Can Meto </b> and I would like to introduce myself via this interesting assignment that has been provided.! I am from
                <em>Turkey</em>, and I have been living in <em>Canada</em> for 10 years now. I arrived at the age of 11 and am currently
                21. I have been video editing for over 6 years now since a very young age and this is one of the main
                hobbies that have made me choose this program.
            </p>

            <p>

                I am currently also enrolled in <em>Carleton University</em>, Cognitive Science program with a minor in Computer
                Science as a second-year student. This program is mainly interested in explaining the human mind using
                psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and translating these findings into computers. (Such
                as artificial intelligence). I am looking to combine both of these knowledge in my line of work get the
                best of both worlds since my passion has always been technology.
